# Contributing guidelines for repositories in the Symbol Not Found organization

## Steps for creating good issues and/or pull requests

Any Pull Request of significant size or functionality should include a reference
to an issue that justifies the change.  Small patches, refactors and version
updates may bypass issue creation but must provide justification in the PR and
commit messages.

When creating issues, specify the intended/expected behavior and any details
about the runtime environment (browser, platform).  Avoid giving any personally
identifiable details about yourself or others.  Issues relating to your account
on any Symbol Not Found service should be provided via the web site while logged
in or in the application where you are having an issue.

When creating Pull Requests, provide a test case if possible and run the
integration tests if provided in the repository.  Build and Test setup steps
are included in each repository's `README.md`
