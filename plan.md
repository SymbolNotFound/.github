# Executive Summary

There is a nexus developing at the intersection of game development (design and
production), artificial intelligence and the simulation of virtual worlds.  They
share a common need for logical consistency and reproducable behavior, but the
conventional development environment does more to fight this than help it.

Despite the expectation of consistency, AAA games are often buggy when released
and many studios are reluctant to make significant gameplay-balance changes, as
every change needs altering of at least a backend and frontend, as well as the
protocol and any persistent state.  It may not be as costly as a Mars payload
overshooting its target, but a game's success is often dependent on its initial
reception, and needs to have enough players engaged to keep it interesting for
new players.  This heightens the risk of making disruptive changes to gameplay.

These industries have all seen incredible growth and consistent demand, despite
the reputation for initially buggy releases and problematic multiplayer.  With
a development environment that focuses on the rule definitions, code-generating
the independent system components from these rules, entire categories of error
can be easily avoided.

The primary market is hosting and distribution of games and simulated worlds.
There are some additional markets adjacent to this which are also worthy of
exploring: customized presentation of games, with revenue-sharing for artists;
competitions between reasoning agents, demonstrating their relative performance;
competitions between humans for prize winnings; competition between humans and
computers of relative strength; evaluation of games, automating the difficult
play-testing process where loopholes may be discovered and exploited; automatic
assessment of a game's elegance and complexity based on well-defined metrics.
If the games are developed with attention to the common game mechanics, a kind
of family tree of games throughout history can be indexed directly via their
rule definitions.

The notion of General Game Playing competitions has existed for about a decade,
and there have been a few non-research products as well, but each of these has
only covered a select category of game types and most of them are not currently
maintained.  With the emerging ability to perform the logical unification and
constraint satisfaction in massively parallel compute on the GPU, there is a
unique opportunity for innovating something profoundly exciting in this space.
